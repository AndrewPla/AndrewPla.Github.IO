# PowerShell Summit

Goodness gracious that was fun! I was fortunate enough to attend the PowerShell Summit after getting the Scholarship. That was the best week of my life. It was something that I was massively looking forward to for so long. I was super nervous, but I also knew that it would be an amazing time and an amazing oppourtunity. I'm going to go over some of the major takeaways for me at this event and then I will hit on some of the awesome social interactions that I had.

## Scholarship

I was browsing twitter and keeping up with all of the cool new PowerShell happenings when I stumbled across the scholarship application form. As I started reading through it I knew that this was an amazing opportunity that I couldn't pass on. I got a babysitter for the kids and began writing my application. I touched on all of the fantastic things that PowerShell has enabled me to do so far, as we all some of the adversity that I have experienced in life. I submitted it not feeling all too confident, but was satisfied that I at least took the opportunity.

Every year at work we go to a 1 day security conference. Me and a couple of my coworkers loaded into the car to begin the 2 hour trip back home. I opened up my laptop and saw an email from Don FREAKING Jones. I figured out pretty quick that I got the scholarship and was going to be attending the Summit. I instantly started tearing up because this is such a big opportunity for me. I called my wife and started freaking out because she knew how important this was for me.

This came at such a perfect point in my life as well. Just a few months prior to this I had what was, for me, a quarter-life crisis. My best friend passed away after a long battle with brain cancer. He was sick for a while, but I wasn't really emotionally prepared for when he passed even though we knew it was coming. He was the nicest person that I've ever known and helped me grow so much as a person.  During the time that he was sick we spent a lot of time together and shared a lot of really deep, raw moments together. He was a really well-rounded and compassionate person. His passing left me wondering what life was really about and how I should live mine. I discovered a lot about myself during this time and it changed the way that I viewed things. My friend encouraged me to pursue my dreams. I've reflected back on those conversations several times and they really pushed me to get outside of my comfort zone and to try living in the moment. I recall a time when I had my head in hands and a relieving thought came to me "Holy shit life can rough. I'm definitely a real adult now." I'm really proud of the person that I am and I'm not sure I could say that quite as confidently as before this whole experience.

I guess this is a bit of an aside, but I can't stress the timing of everything. Things were pretty dark for me and it felt like receiving this opportunity was my chance to move on and get some awesome things going in my life. Everything about this whole experience has felt so surreal, maybe I will be able to have a better understanding of everything in the future because it still feels like I'm living a dream.

So now that I have the scholarship, what am I going to do with it? I had no choice but to try to dive as deep into powershell as I could in the months leading up to the Summit. I reread the MoL books, played with PS at every opportunity, and read as many blogs as I could get my hands on. In the end I think that I ended up burning myself out a bit, but it worked out. I got tons of help from some awesome community members along the way.

## Trip Time

Whew I had an insane amount of anxiety prior to this trip. I've been working from home for a while now and leaving that environment was really strange.  I didn't sleep at all the night before my flight, but I knew that I was going to have fun once I got there. I got some advice from the community that I should do a lightning demo without question. They told me that it was a fantastic chance to get some experience speaking. I decided that I wasn't going to worry about committing to the lightning demo quite yet. I needed to arrive and get acclimated before I threw on a bit more stress. It was always in the back of my head though, darn anxiety!

I arrive at the airport at 5 AM and hand the TSA agent my ID and boarding pass. She takes a quick glance at my ID then makes eye contact as she asks me if I'm 17 or under (I'm 24). Apparantly I'm much more of a morning person than I thought! The flight was nice, and I arrived after a long nap. Once I'm past security I calm down a bit and realize that its actually happening. I had a smile that I couldn't wipe off. It was real. I was going to the Summit! Time to board the plane.

After several hours I arrived in Seattle! I tried meeting up with [Brandon Lundt](https://twitter.com/BrandonDaLundt) to share an Uber, but it wasn't meant to be. I hopped in an Uber and just as I was turning the corner I saw Kris Powell! This was freaking awesome! Are you kidding me?! I haven't even left the airport yet and I have already run into one of the people who GREATLY aided in me getting started in automation in general.  I yell out the window "Kris Powell you're awesome!" He gives me a surprised look and an awkward wave as my Uber driver drove off. No Regrets! More on this later.

## Hotel, Motel, Seattle Marriott

I arrive at the Hotel and get settled in. The anxiety is gone for the most part and I'm STOKED to get things started. I decide that instead of waiting in my hotel until the next event that I was going to explore Seattle! I'm usually more of a stay at home kinda guy, but I was feeling like I couldn't let this amazing opportunity go to waste. I got some awesome coffee from Starbucks and made small talk with the employees. I went back to the Hotel and I ran into [Jeff Hicks](https://twitter.com/JeffHicks). This was rather surreal for me because I'm a massive fan and consumer of his content. He is one of the rockstars that I HAD to meet while I was here. Shortly after I also ran into Don Jones. Holy crap what a way to start things off.

There was an event that evening that involved Alchohol and talking, which is a combination that I'm fond of. I met up with this awesome dude, [Mark Kellerman](https://twitter.com/mkellerman) and we chatted for a bit which broke the ice for me at the event. This was his first time at the Summit as well and I felt much more relaxed after having a conversation with someone and realizing that everyone here is a person, not a rockstar like I want to believe.  I went full social butterfly mode. I don't really know what it was, but everything felt so right and comfortable. I felt like I was with my people. I bumped into several people at the event, and eventually ran into [Fred](https://twitter.com/FredWeinmann) and [Mathias Jessen](https://twitter.com/IISResetMe). We went out for dinner and I had a blast. The whole time I was just in shock that I was getting along so well with everyone and how nice everyone was. It felt like a big family. I went to bed reassured that I was in the right place and I knew that the rest of the trip had a whole lot more awesome in store.

## Dinner and Drinks - Hey awesome guy

I went out to dinner with a large group and ended up stumbling into Kris Powell (the man that I yelled at from an Uber) and Jordan Hammond who both work for a company that makes a product that we use at work, PDQ. They both post blog articles and occasionaly host the weekly webcast that they do. We got to talk shop about their product and got to talk about some awesome powershell stuff. Their webcasts originally got me started into automation and prompted me to buy the first Month of Lunches book.

I went back for a drink at the hotel bar and ran into a whole slew of fantastic people that I would grow closer with as the week went on. It was so special to just feel comfortable walking up to a group of PowerShellers and just hop right in. I got so much fantastic advice from people over the course of the week in that bar/lounge area. I got to become friends with quite a few killer people. A lot of the social events ended up being more valuable than some of the sessions and that isn't to downplay the sessions; they were fantastic. There just something about being able to have a conversation with other people and share experiences and different things we've encountered in PowerShell. 

## Lightning Demo

After going back and forth several times I decided that I was going to go through with the lightning demo. I nervously typed up my entry and submitted it to Warren Frame. I'm usually comfortable on stages, but it was pretty intimidating being in front of a whole bunch of people. I nervously sipped down my coffee and headed on stage. It went well and I was relieved that I had actually done it. I look forward to being more comfortable on stage next time and it was a great chance to get my feet wet. Thanks so much to [Chris Gardner](https://twitter.com/HalbaradKenafin) and [Herb Martin](https://twitter.com/HerbMartin) for really encouraging me to do the lightning demo. There were a lot of really interesting lightning demos and I was mostly just relieved that I had gotten it out of the way.

I decided to get a few people together to go to dinner.

## Meeting Mentors/Friends

 Earlier in my PowerShell journey Josh would stream himself writing powershell code on youtube. He taught me how to write a function that accepts pipeline input. He demystified what a high level PowerSheller is really like. Seeing him code made me realize that I could do it  also. I didn't need to be some kind of supergenius in order to write cohesive modules. I just needed to plan things out appropriately. Several months after that he DM'ed me on twitter asking if I had started posting on Github yet. Thanks to his kick I got started! I was lucky enough to run into him several times at the conference, even having an awesome dinner with him. In the months leading up to the summit he was one person that I would always recognize in the Virtual User groups because he, like me, couldn't get enough! He demystified a lot of things for me and encouraged me to do more. Thanks, Josh!

I had a great conversation with Adam Bertram, who won a PowerShell Community Award for his contributions! As a matter of fact, the comment from my submission was displayed on his powerpoint slide along with a few others. My comment began with 'Adam knows his shit..', but continued on to talk about how the most impactful stuff that I got from his was actually his more self-help content. It ended up being a funny conversation starter and I had a great talk with Adam. His [article](https://www.adamtheautomator.com/introverts-guide-tech-conferences/) on how to handle conferences helped me really helped me to feel prepared for the conference. He also bugged me on twitter about starting a blog, thanks for that!

Josh Duffield was freaking awesome to meet! He wrote a blog post a few months ago about being a craftsman that really resonated with me. I started to realize that I should treat what I do as a craft. I discovered this article around the same time that I read "Be the Master" by Don Jones. It kinda changed the way that I viewed my career. Thanks for the great content, Josh.

I ran into [Mark Kraus](https://twitter.com/markekraus) and had to get a photo with him. My long term goal for myself is to have a grasp on technology to the degree that he does. It's so awesome to see what he's done with the web cmdlets and he is super helpful in the community. I actually bought him reddit gold at one point because I was shocked at how friendly and open he is to sharing his knowledge so it was cool to meet him in person. Rock on, Mark!

Fred really helped me feel like I was ready for the Summit. He helped me a bunch leading into the Summit and even walked me through my first contribution to a project on Github! He re-ignited my fire for PowerShell Studio as well. His passion for Powershell is infectious!

I got to meet both [Jeffrey Snover](https://twitter.com/jsnover) and [Jason Helmick](https://twitter.com/theJasonHelmick), their [MVA course](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/getting-started-with-microsoft-powershell-8276) really got me going with powershell. I didn't get to grab a photo with Jason, but I did get one with [Bruce Payette](https://twitter.com/BrucePayette) and Jeffrey Snover.

## Major Takeaways

- I'm in the right place doing the right things in life right now.
- I'm insanely passionate about PowerShell and want to empower others. To quote the twitter bio of [Michael Lombardi](https://twitter.com/barbariankb) "just trying to be a force multiplier for everyone I meet."
- It's okay to be super into something and want to dive as deep as possible.
- It's okay to not be the best in the room
- It's rewarding to start conversations about things you don't know with people who love sharing knowledge

I think that Ican provide something to the community and I look forward to contributing to a community that helped me out so much.

I learned that taking the initiative and starting conversations can be extremely rewarding. I had some AMAZING interactions with lots of 

I made so many great friends at this event.

I was talking to [Charles Jones](https://twitter.com/charleswj81) and when he described the way that he approaches learning about things it really gave me insight into some changes that I need to be making in my approach.
