# PowerShell Summit

I was fortunate enough to attend the PowerShell Summit after becoming their first [scholarship](https://powershell.org/2017/11/10/powershell-devops-global-summit-2018-scholarship-recipient/) recipient. This week proved to be more valuable to me than I anticipated going into, and I had high hopes going in! The Summit ended up being much more than just a PowerShell conference for me and I think that I got a lot of insight into my personal life. As the week went on I kept noticing how amazing our community is and how accepted I felt into it. This may be more of a story than an event recap, but I think it's really cool how everything is comi BE CONTINUED



## Pre-Scholarship Quarter-Life Crisis

A few months prior to the beginning of the Scholarship/Summit storyline begins I had what I refer to as my quarter-life crisis. My best friend passed away after a long battle with brain cancer. He was sick for a while, but I wasn't really emotionally prepared for when he passed even though we knew it was coming. . I visited him almost every week that he was sick and we grew really close.

He was the nicest person that I've ever known and helped me grow so much as a person.  During the time that he was sick we spent a lot of time together and shared a lot of really deep, raw moments together. He was a really well-rounded and compassionate person. His passing left me wondering what life was really about and how I should live mine.

## That was deep. Relevence?

I realized how fragile and temporary life is. I began reevaulating if I was living my life with purpose. I noticed how peple could fall into patterns and just see the years fly by without even noticing. I'm afraid of this. I learned that being a nerd is a great thing and I should embrace it. I should totally geek out on things that I love and follow my dreams. The timing of this is important because I feel like it left me primed and ready to pounce on whatever cool things life had to offer.

## Scholarship

I was browsing twitter and keeping up with all of the cool new PowerShell happenings when I stumbled across the scholarship application. As I started reading through it I knew that this was an amazing opportunity that I couldn't pass on. I got a babysitter (Thanks, Mom!) for the kids and began writing my application as my wife was there. This felt like such a perfect fit. I submitted my application not feeling all too confident, but was satisfied that I at least took advantage of the opportunity.

So now that I have the scholarship, what am I going to do with it? I had no choice but to try to dive as deep into powershell as I could in the months leading up to the Summit. I reread the MoL books, played with PS at every opportunity,and read as many blogs as I could get my hands on. In the end I think that I ended up burning myself out a bit, but it worked out and I got tons of help from some awesome community members along the way.

Even before the Summit began I kinda new that me + PowerShell were going to be a 'thing' :). Receiving the scholarship was enough of an affirmation to kick me into gear and realize that the only barrier between who I am and who I dream of being is just time and dedication.

## Trip Time

Whew, I had an insane amount of anxiety prior to this trip. I've been working from home for a while now and leaving that environment was really strange.  I didn't sleep at all the night before my flight, but I knew that I was going to have fun once I got there. I got some advice from the community that I should do a lightning demo without question. They told me that it was a fantastic chance to get some experience speaking. I decided that I wasn't going to worry about committing to the lightning demo quite yet. I needed to arrive and get acclimated before I threw on a bit more stress. It was always in the back of my head though, darn anxiety!

I arrive at the airport at 5 AM and hand the TSA agent my ID and boarding pass. She takes a quick glance at my ID then makes eye contact as she asks me if I'm 17 or under (I'm 24). Apparantly I'm much more of a morning person than I thought! Once I'm past security I calm down a bit and realize that it's actually happening. This thing that I've been stoked about for months is actually happening!  I had a smile that I couldn't wipe off. It was real. I was going to the Summit! Time to board the plane.

After several hours I arrived in Seattle! I tried meeting up with [Brandon Lundt](https://twitter.com/BrandonDaLundt) to share an Uber, but it wasn't meant to be. I hopped in an Uber and just as I was turning the corner I saw Kris Powell! This was freaking awesome! Are you kidding me?! I haven't even left the airport yet and I have already run into one of the people who GREATLY aided in me getting started in automation in general.  I yell out the window "Kris Powell you're awesome!" He gives me a surprised look and an awkward wave as my Uber driver drove off. No Regrets! More on this later.

## Hotel, Motel, Seattle Marriott

I arrive at the Hotel and get settled in. The anxiety is gone for the most part and I'm STOKED to get things started. I decide that instead of waiting in my hotel until the next event that I was going to explore Seattle! I'm usually more of a stay at home kinda guy, but I was feeling like I couldn't let this amazing opportunity go to waste. I got some awesome coffee from Starbucks and made small talk with the employees. I went back to the Hotel and I ran into [Jeff Hicks](https://twitter.com/JeffHicks). This was rather surreal for me because I'm a massive fan and consumer of his content. He is one of the rockstars that I HAD to meet while I was here. Shortly after I also ran into Don Jones. Holy crap what a way to start things off.

There was an event that evening that involved Alchohol and talking, which is a combination that I'm fond of. I met up with this awesome dude, [Mark Kellerman](https://twitter.com/mkellerman) and we chatted for a bit which broke the ice for me at the event. This was his first time at the Summit as well and I felt much more relaxed after having a conversation with someone and realizing that everyone here is a person, not a rockstar like I want to believe.  I went full social butterfly mode. I don't really know what it was, but everything felt so right and comfortable. I felt like I was with my people. I bumped into several people at the event, and eventually ran into [Fred](https://twitter.com/FredWeinmann) and [Mathias Jessen](https://twitter.com/IISResetMe). We went out for dinner and I had a blast. The whole time I was just in shock that I was getting along so well with everyone and how nice everyone was. It felt like a big family. I went to bed reassured that I was in the right place and I knew that the rest of the trip had a whole lot more awesome in store.

## Dinner and Drinks - Hey awesome guy

One night, I went out to dinner with a large group and ended up stumbling into Kris Powell (the man that I yelled at from an Uber) and Jordan Hammond who both work for a company that makes a product that we use at work, PDQ. They both post blog articles and occasionaly host the weekly webcast that they do. We got to talk shop about their product and got to talk about some awesome powershell stuff. Their webcasts originally got me started into automation and prompted me to buy the first Month of Lunches book.

I went back for a drink at the hotel bar and ran into a whole slew of fantastic people that I would grow closer with as the week went on. It was so special to just feel comfortable walking up to a group of PowerShellers and just hop right in. I got so much fantastic advice from people over the course of the week in that bar/lounge area. I got to become friends with quite a few killer people as well. A lot of the social events ended up being more valuable than some of the sessions and that isn't to downplay the sessions; they were fantastic.

## Lightning Demo

After going back and forth several times I decided that I was going to go through with the lightning demo. I nervously typed up my entry and submitted it to Warren Frame. I'm usually comfortable on stages, but it was pretty intimidating being in front of a whole bunch of people. I nervously sipped down my coffee and headed on stage. It went well and I was relieved that I had actually done it. I look forward to being more comfortable on stage next time and it was a great chance to get my feet wet. Thanks so much to [Chris Gardner](https://twitter.com/HalbaradKenafin) and [Herb Martin](https://twitter.com/HerbMartin) for really encouraging me to do the lightning demo. There were a lot of really interesting lightning demos and I was mostly just relieved that I had gotten it out of the way.

## Dinner Time

After the lightning demos were over I decided to get a few people together to go to dinner. I think that a conversation with Fred, Josh King, and Mathias would be fantastic so I reached out to them and made plans. We went to a great dinner and got a couple of friends, [Jeffrey Hayes](https://twitter.com/jeffery_hayes) and [Scott Dowling](https://twitter.com/ScriptingKnurd), to join us. If you are going to be a first time summiteer you definitely should reach out to people and take initiative. We went to a place that Fred really raved about. We had great food and great conversations.

## Meeting Mentors/Friends

 Earlier in my PowerShell journey [Josh King](https://twitter.com/WindosNZ) would stream himself writing powershell code on youtube. He taught me how to write a function that accepts pipeline input. He demystified what a high level PowerSheller is really like. Seeing him code made me realize that I could do it  also. I didn't need to be some kind of supergenius in order to write cohesive modules. I just needed to plan things out appropriately. Several months after that he DM'ed me on twitter asking if I had started posting on Github yet. Thanks to his kick I got started! I was lucky enough to run into him several times at the conference, even having an awesome dinner with him. In the months leading up to the summit he was one person that I would always recognize in the Virtual User groups because he, like me, cant get enough PowerShell! He demystified a lot of things for me and encouraged me to do more. Thanks, Josh!

I had a great conversation with Adam Bertram, who won a PowerShell Community Award for his contributions! As a matter of fact, the comment from my submission was displayed on his powerpoint slide along with a few others. My comment began with 'Adam knows his shit..', but continued on to talk about how the most impactful stuff that I got from his was actually more of his self-help content. It ended up being a funny conversation starter and I had a great talk with Adam. His [article](https://www.adamtheautomator.com/introverts-guide-tech-conferences/) on how to handle conferences helped me really helped me to feel prepared for the conference. He also bugged me on twitter about starting a blog, thanks for that!

[Josh Duffney](https://twitter.com/joshduffney) was freaking awesome to meet! He wrote a blog post a few months ago about being a craftsman that really resonated with me. I started to realize that I should treat what I do as a craft. I discovered this article around the same time that I read "Be the Master" by Don Jones. It's exciting to see this whole craftsman mindset really flourishing in the community. Thanks for the great content, Josh. 

I ran into [Mark Kraus](https://twitter.com/markekraus) and had to get a photo with him. My long term goal for myself is to have a grasp on technology to the degree that he does. It's so awesome to see what he's done with the web cmdlets and he is super helpful in the community. I actually bought him reddit gold at one point because I was shocked at how friendly and open he is to sharing his knowledge so it was cool to meet him in person. Rock on, Mark!

Fred really helped me feel like I was ready for the Summit. He helped me a bunch leading into the Summit and even walked me through my first contribution to a project on Github! He re-ignited my fire for PowerShell Studio as well. His passion for Powershell is infectious and I really appreciate how much time he spent on me!

[Chris Gardner](https://twitter.com/HalbaradKenafin) is super active on the [PowerShell Slack](http://slack.poshcode.org/) and has helped me on several occasions. I was looking forward to meeting him, but on the second night I wondered how I hadn't run into him yet. It turns out that I just hadn't connected the dots that he was actually Chris Gardner. He works with this lively developer, [Riccardo Viglianisi](https://twitter.com/CaptainShmaser), who is an absolute blast to hang out with. After the pub crawl on Thursday 7 of us got an UberX to head back to the Hotel for the night. It turns out that we had the coolest Uber driver ever and she let us play music. We had our own version of Karaoke and it was so much fun just letting loose.

I really could keep going all day long, but I'm not sure that would be a good read. 

## Major Takeaways

- I'm in the right place doing the right things in life right now.
- I'm insanely passionate about PowerShell and want to empower others. To quote the twitter bio of [Michael Lombardi](https://twitter.com/barbariankb) "just trying to be a force multiplier for everyone I meet."
- It's okay to be super into something and want to dive as deep as possible.
- 

I think that I can provide something to the community and I look forward to contributing to the community that helped me out so much.


I made so many great friends at this event.

I was talking to [Charles Jones](https://twitter.com/charleswj81) and when he described the way that he approaches learning about things it really gave me insight into some changes that I need to be making in my approach.
